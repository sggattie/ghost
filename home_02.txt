After exploration, you come back to where you belong. Home.
People are gathered, mourning your loss, celebrating your life.
Your ancestor says, "welcome home".
They're back from your funeral, at that awkward after-stage with lots of cold cuts and cheese platters. You missed your own funeral.
How rude. Everything is shaking a little. People perk up. The tremors end and everyone goes about their business. Your distant relatives eye up your stuff.
