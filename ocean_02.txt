Where to start, where to dive into the endless deep blue? 
The outline of a shark right at the surface is just visible.
What is it gonna do, kill you again? Go for it.
You dive through the shark, get a split second view of its innards,
and before you know it you're in the thick of the briny deep.
You look back up at the shark, unscathed. Unaffected.
A school of fish passes through you with no effort, no acknowledgement.
As it passes, it's broken up by a tremor. Waves throughout the ocean.
Some disturbance. What could it be? Even the shark swims away.
