You go home. Nobody is home. The house is empty. Your stuff mourns.
A great ancestor arrives. They knew you would come here first. 
"Welcome to your true home, your final resting place." they say.
"What do I do? Where do I go? What happened to the rest of my family?"
Your ancestor explains all the rules of this world as he has many times before to many of your fellow deceased relatives. 
You are free, as much as you are not free. Where to now?
