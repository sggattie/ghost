PLunging just below the surface, you can't hear or feel a change.
The water grows a deeper blue and the creatures become more plentiful.
All-natural Atlantis. It's still the endlessness you knew it to be,
but you can see for miles. A shadlow casts itself over you.
It dwarfs everything but the ocean itself. A whale shark.
What is it gonna do, kill you again?
